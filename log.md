# 100 Days Of Code - Log

---

### Day 1: January 17, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Today I started freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification. I completed 6 steps: Cat Photo App, Cafe Menu, Colored Markers, Registration Form, Rothko Painting and Photo Gallery.

**Thoughts**: It was a tiring but very productive day!
